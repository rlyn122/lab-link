#Project Description

Lab Link is a conversational chatbot designed to help Emory University students discover research labs
that align with their academic interests, skills, and goals. Unlike traditional methods that rely on outdated
lab websites, Lab Link uses real-time publication data from sources like Google Scholar using the Scholarly
Python package to provide up-to-date insights into ongoing faculty research within the Computer Science
(CS) and Quantitative Theory and Methods (QTM) departments. Using natural language processing (NLP)
and Googleâ€™s Gemma model, we developed an LLM based approach to analyze recent faculty publications,
allowing students to engage with current research rather than static summaries.
