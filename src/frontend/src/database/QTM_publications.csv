Weihua An,Causal network analysis,2022,https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-030320-102100,"Fueled by recent advances in statistical modeling and the rapid growth of network data, social network analysis has become increasingly popular in sociology and related disciplines. However, a significant amount of work in the field has been descriptive and correlational, which prevents the findings from being more rigorously translated into practices and policies. This article provides a review of the popular models and methods for causal network analysis, with a focus on causal inference threats (such as measurement error, missing data, network endogeneity, contextual confounding, simultaneity, and collinearity) and potential solutions (such as instrumental variables, specialized experiments, and leveraging longitudinal data). It covers major models and methods for both network formation and network effects and for both sociocentric networks and egocentric networks. Lastly, this review also discusses future …"
Weihua An,Friendship network formation in Chinese middle schools: Patterns of inequality and homophily,2022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321000599,"Previous studies on adolescent friendship network formation emphasize the roles played by individual characteristics, structural opportunities, and endogenous tie formation processes. This study extends previous studies in three major aspects: 1) developing and testing theories of status differential (i.e., friendship ties are more likely to run from low status subjects to high status subjects than vice versa) and differential homophily (i.e., homophily is stronger between high status subjects than between low status subjects) through modeling tie-mixing effects of individual characteristics, 2) including qualitative analyses to elaborate selected mechanisms, and 3) comparing selected friendship patterns between China and the U.S. The extended framework is applied to analyzing survey data obtained from 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. The results show that friendship ties are unevenly distributed by …"
Weihua An,"You said, they said: A framework on informant accuracy with application to studying self-reports and peer-reports",2022,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873321001155,"Informants have been used extensively to provide information on others. However, informant accuracy has rarely been systematically studied. In this paper I argue that studying informant accuracy both helps deepen our understanding about how perceptions of others are configured by personal and network factors and helps develop better methods to use informant reports to correct self-reporting bias. I propose a framework (a systematic conceptualization) that links informant accuracy to not only informant characteristics, but also alter characteristics, dyadic characteristics shared by the informant and the alter, and characteristics of the behavior being reported on. I apply the framework to analyzing self-reports and peer-reports of smoking among 4094 middle school students in China. The analyses present novel strategies to validate a behavior when the truth is unknown, confirm previous findings (e.g., central …"
Weihua An,Opening the blackbox of treatment interference: Tracing treatment diffusion through network analysis,2022,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0049124119852384,"Causal inference under treatment interference is a challenging but important problem. Past studies usually make strong assumptions on the structure of treatment interference in order to estimate causal treatment effects while accounting for the effect of treatment interference. In this article, we view treatment diffusion as a concrete form of treatment interference that is prevalent in social settings and also as an outcome of central interest. Specifically, we analyze data from a smoking prevention intervention conducted with 4,094 students in six middle schools in China. We measure treatment interference by tracing how the distributed intervention brochures are shared by students, which provides information to construct the so-called treatment diffusion networks. Besides providing descriptive analyses, we use exponential random graph models to model the treatment diffusion networks in order to reveal covariates and …"

Weihua An,A tale of twin dependence: a new multivariate regression model and an FGLS estimator for analyzing outcomes with network dependence,2023,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00491241211031263,"In this article, I present a new multivariate regression model for analyzing outcomes with network dependence. The model is capable to account for two types of outcome dependence including the mean dependence that allows the outcome to depend on selected features of a known dependence network and the error dependence that allows the outcome to be additionally correlated based on patterned connections in the dependence network (e.g., according to whether the ties are asymmetric, mutual, or triadic). For example, when predicting a group of students’ smoking status, the outcome can depend on the students’ positions in their friendship network and also be correlated among friends. I show that analyses ignoring the mean dependence can lead to severe bias in the estimated coefficients while analyses ignoring the error dependence can lead to inefficient inferences and failures in recognizing …"
Weihua An,Characterization of trajectories of physical activity and cigarette smoking from early adolescence to adulthood,2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-023-17365-1,"Cigarette smoking and physical inactivity are two critical risk factors for noncommunicable diseases and all-cause mortality. However, few studies have compared the long-term trajectories of both behaviors, as well as multilevel factors associated with trajectory patterns. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health) Wave I through V survey data, this study characterized distinct subgroups of the population sharing similar behavioral patterns from adolescence to adulthood, as well as predictors of subgroup membership for physical activity (PA) and cigarette smoking behavior respectively.Using the Add Health Wave I through V survey data, we identified the optimal number of latent classes and class-specific trajectories of PA and cigarette smoking from early adolescence to adulthood, fitting latent growth mixture models with standardized PA score and past 30 …"
Weihua An,"Race, state surveillance, and policy spillover: Do restrictive immigration policies affect citizen earnings?",2023,https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/102/2/681/7079025,"This paper investigates whether restrictive immigration policy affects earnings among White, African-American, and Latinx US citizens. Incorporating sociological theories of race that point to state surveillance of Black and Latinx bodies as a linchpin of racial inequality, we ask: Do immigration policies that expand the reach of law enforcement spill over to lower or to raise earnings of employed US citizens? If so, are the effects of these policies greater for Latinx and African-American citizens compared to their White counterparts? Are the effects of these policies stronger among Latinx and African-American men—who are more directly targeted by surveillance policing as a function of their gender—than for co-ethnic women? To investigate these questions, we combine two nationally representative longitudinal datasets—the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of …"

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many children have been out of school for more than six months, missing face-toface interaction with their friends, unable to visit with extended family, and experiencing unaccustomed isolation. With little support from kin and friends, pandemic parenting is more than a full-time job. Both challenging and exhausting, the demands of the day leave many parents eager to put their kids to bed, hoping for a reprieve from the day’s events. Amid this fragmenting of relationships, neighbors are rediscovering each other while social distancing outdoors, and others create and experience Zoom memorials for those loved ones who have been lost to COVID-19 or something else. Still others have lost their jobs or have been furloughed and are relying on friends and family for support in ways they could not have imagined before. It is a time of …"
Weihua An,Testing a Population-Based Outreach Intervention for Ovarian Cancer Survivors to Encourage their Close Relatives to Consider Genetic Counseling,2024,https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/33/9/1185/747328,"Most relatives of women with ovarian cancer are unaware of their increased risk for cancer and their eligibility for genetic counseling. State cancer registries offer a platform to communicate about inherited risk to this population.We conducted a two-arm randomized trial to test a theory-based communication intervention—Your Family Connects (YFC)—compared to the standard Georgia Cancer Registry (GCR) contact. A total of 1,938 eligible ovarian cancer survivors were randomly assigned to either the YFC arm (n = 969) or the Standard Care arm (n = 969). We assessed the number of ovarian cancer survivors and their close relatives who logged on to the study website by arm.Survivor reach was significantly higher in the Standard Care arm than YFC (20.8% vs. 15.2%, respectively; P < 0.001). However, reach to relatives was …"
Weihua An,Comparing Egocentric and Sociocentric Centrality Measures in Directed Networks,2024,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/00491241221122606,"Egocentric networks represent a popular research design for network research. However, to what extent and under what conditions egocentric network centrality can serve as reasonable substitutes for their sociocentric counterparts are important questions to study. The answers to these questions are uncertain simply because of the large variety of networks. Hence, this paper aims to provide exploratory answers to these questions by analyzing both empirical and simulated data. Through analyses of various empirical networks (including some classic albeit small ones), this paper shows that egocentric betweenness approximates sociocentric betweenness quite well (the correlation is high across almost all the networks being examined) while egocentric closeness approximates sociocentric closeness only reasonably well (the correlation is a bit lower on average with a larger variance across networks). Simulations …"

One family systems’ construct that can support promotion of family communication regarding inherited disease risk is the notion of “kin keeping.” However, kin keeping and whether it might be capitalized on to encourage family communication about inherited risk has been understudied. The goal of this report was to propose a broadened conceptualization of kin keeping that distinguishes between a structural functional perspective (role conceptualization) and transitional behaviors (skill conceptualization), and to develop and evaluate a scale that would enable this assertion to be tested among a sample of African American community health workers. We developed a scale using four steps: item development using concept analysis and content validity, scale development among a national …"
Michal Arbilly,Gene–culture coevolution in the cognitive domain,2023,https://academic.oup.com/edited-volume/45648/chapter/396358370,"Gene–culture coevolution in the cognitive domain is expected to occur whenever cultural phenomena select for genes that affect cognition. Such cultural selection would occur, for example, if the culture of making certain tools leads to selection that favours genetic variants that somehow make one better at learning to make these tools. While these coevolutionary processes seem probable and important, they are difficult to study because the genetic underpinnings of cognitive traits are often poorly understood. Indeed, most evidence for cognitive gene–culture coevolution are circumstantial or indirect, and the role of such processes is often a topic of debate. This chapter suggests, however, that a strong case for cognitive gene–culture coevolution can be made based on theoretical considerations, which can also guide future work and put current evidence in context. Using a process-based (mechanistic) approach to …"

What makes an individual choose to invest in production versus exploiting the efforts of another? If everyone invests, then exploitative strategies become very profitable; however if everyone is exploitative, there will be no investments to exploit. How does natural selection resolve this dilemma? What can economic institutions do to encourage investment? Can biologists and economists learn from the approach of each other's discipline? This chapter outlines the commonalities and differences in approach of the two disciplines to the general problem of investment versus exploitation. It develops a model to encapsulate the general features of many scenarios ("" games"") involving potential exploitation and explores the benefits of a unified approach, outlining current limitations and important areas for future investigation."
Hun Chung,A formal theory of democratic deliberation,2020,https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/formal-theory-of-democratic-deliberation/78A6828E834595C799DB4103C1C7976B,"Inspired by impossibility theorems of social choice theory, many democratic theorists have argued that aggregative forms of democracy cannot lend full democratic justification for the collective decisions reached. Hence, democratic theorists have turned their attention to deliberative democracy, according to which “outcomes are democratically legitimate if and only if they could be the object of a free and reasoned agreement among equals” (Cohen 1997a, 73). However, relatively little work has been done to offer a formal theory of democratic deliberation. This article helps fill that gap by offering a formal theory of three different modes of democratic deliberation: myopic discussion, constructive discussion, and debate. We show that myopic discussion suffers from indeterminacy of long run outcomes, while constructive discussion and debate are conclusive. Finally, unlike the other two modes of deliberation, debate is …"
Hun Chung,Rawls’s self-defeat: a formal analysis,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-0079-4,"One of John Rawls’s major aims, when he wrote A Theory of Justice, was to present a superior alternative to utilitarianism. Rawls’s worry was that utilitarianism may fail to protect the fundamental rights and liberties of persons in its attempt to maximize total social welfare. Rawls’s main argument against utilitarianism was that, for such reasons, the representative parties in the original position will not choose utilitarianism, but will rather choose his justice as fairness, which he believed would securely protect the worth of everybody’s basic rights and liberties. In this paper, I will argue that, under close formal examination, Rawls’s argument against utilitarianism is self-defeating. That is, I will argue that Rawls’s own reasons, assumptions, and the many theoretical devices he employs demonstrably imply that the representative parties in the original position will choose utilitarianism instead of justice as fairness."
Hun Chung,The Well‐Ordered Society under Crisis: A Formal Analysis of Public Reason vs. Convergence Discourse,2020,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12445,"A well‐ordered society faces a crisis whenever a sufficient number of noncompliers enter into the political system. This has the potential to destabilize liberal democratic political order. This article provides a formal analysis of two competing solutions to the problem of political stability offered in the public reason liberalism literature—namely, using public reason or using convergence discourse to restore liberal democratic political order in the well‐ordered society. The formal analyses offered in this article show that using public reason fails completely, and using convergent discourse, although doing better, has its own critical limitations that have not been previously recognized properly."
Hun Chung,Diversity and rights: a social choice-theoretic analysis of the possibility of public reason,2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-018-1737-4,"Public reason liberalism takes as its starting point the deep and irreconcilable diversity we find characterizing liberal societies. This deep and irreconcilable diversity creates problems for social order. One method for adjudicating these conflicts is through the use of rights. This paper is about the ability of such rights to adjudicate disputes when perspectival disagreements—or disagreements over how to categorize objects in the world—obtain. We present both formal possibility and impossibility results for rights structures under varying degrees of perspectival diversity. We show that though perspectival diversity appears to be a troubling problem for the prospect of stable social order, if rights are defined properly then disagreements can likely be resolved in a consistent manner, achieving social cooperation rather than conflict."

How would this change the choice situation of the original position? In this paper, I present what I call ‘prospect utilitarianism’. Prospect utilitarianism combines the utilitarian social welfare function with individual utility functions characterized by Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory. I will argue that, once prospect utilitarianism is on the table, Rawls's original arguments in support of justice as fairness as well as his arguments against utilitarianism are, at best, inconclusive. This shows that how implausible a choice for utilitarianism in the original position is heavily depends on what one assumes to be general knowledge of human psychology that the original contracting parties know."

Most approaches to this topic have primarily focused on the single person decision-theoretic aspect of the original position. This paper, in contrast, will directly model the basic structure and the economic agents therein to project the economic consequences and social outcomes generated either by utilitarianism or Rawls’s two principles of justice. It will be shown that when the differences in people’s productive abilities are sufficiently great, utilitarianism dominates Rawls’s two principles of justice by providing a higher level of overall well-being to every member of society. Whenever this is the case, the parties can rely on the Principle of Dominance (which is a direct implication of instrumental rationality) to choose utilitarianism over Rawls’s two principles of justice …"

Hun Chung,Locke’s state of nature and its epistemic deficit: a game-theoretic analysis,2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-022-03582-5,"Locke rejected anarchism. Locke defended the universal necessity of political governments on the grounds that the state of nature will occasionally generate the inconveniences of war. The standard interpretation of Locke identifies three main causes of war in the state of nature: the lack of a common judge, moral disagreement over the law of nature, and self-love. In this paper, I argue that the combination of these three factors does not guarantee that war will occur in every plausible scenarios of Locke’s state of nature. Instead, in order for war to occur at least sometimes in every plausible scenario of Locke’s state of nature, there has to be some sort of epistemic deficit. In this paper, I show via the tools of modern game theory, how Locke’s state of nature may occasionally generate war by two kinds of epistemic problems implied by Locke’s own epistemology: (a) disagreements in subjective probabilities, and (b …"
Hun Chung,(The Impossibility of) Deliberation‐Consistent Social Choice,2024,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12792,"There is now a growing consensus among democratic theorists that we should incorporate both “democratic deliberation” and “aggregative voting” into our democratic processes. But how should the two democratic mechanisms of deliberation and voting interact? In this article, we introduce a new axiom, which we call “Nonnegative Response toward Successful Deliberation” (NNRD). The basic idea is that if some individuals change their preferences toward other individuals’ preferences through democratic deliberation, then the social choice rule should not make everybody who has successfully persuaded others through reasoned deliberation worse off than what they would have achieved without deliberation. We prove an impossibility theorem that shows that there exists no aggregation rule that can simultaneously satisfy NNRD along with other mild axioms that reflect deliberative democracy's core commitment …"
Hun Chung,Formal models in normative political theory,2024,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/09516298241266267,"This article revisits the conventional distinction in political science between ‘positive’ and ‘normative’ political theory, particularly the belief that formal and mathematical methods are only pertinent to positive political theory. We argue that formal models are equally valuable in normative political theory for three reasons: they can make thought experiments more rigorous, they can demonstrate the consistency of normative principles, and they can provide insights into the practical workings of novel institutional arrangements in the absence of empirical data. The integration of formal models into normative political theory presents challenges, including the development of criteria for evaluating these models and potential shifts in research focus. Integration can also strengthen political theory’s tenuous role in the political science discipline."

The basic idea is that each person is given the power to create any possible world and its inhabitants by imagining them. Two definitions of stability have been proposed: (a) the non-circular definition according to which a world is stable if and only if nobody can imagine a better world and (b) the circular definition according to which a world is stable if and only if nobody can imagine a better world that is also stable. In this paper, we prove four theorems (namely, the indeterminacy theorem, the stable dystopia theorem, the nobody’s utopia theorem and the redundancy theorem) that provide us with decisive reasons to reject the circular definition and opt for the non-circular definition of stability to analyse …"

Hun Chung,Why Not Prospect Utilitarianism Instead of Sufficientarianism? A Formal Comparison in Terms of Continuity and Lifeboat Cases,2023,https://web.iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp/methodology/en/dp/images/E-23-003.pdf,"In his 2017 paper,“Prospect Utilitarianism: A Better Alternative to Sufficientarianism,” Hun Chung proposed a theory of distributive justice called ‘Prospect Utilitarianism (PU).’According to Chung, PU retains all the major attractions of sufficientarianism, while avoiding two major problems. The two problems are:(a) sufficientarianism fails to prescribe the right distribution under conditions of scarcity (ie,‘lifeboat’situations), and (b) sufficientarianism fails to provide continuous ethical evaluations. Recently, Ben Davies (2022) and Lasse Nielsen (2019; 2023) have provided a defense of sufficientarianism from these two charges. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the shortcomings in Davies’s and to a lesser degree Nielsen’s defenses of sufficientarianism. Our paper will highlight that both Davies’s and Nielsen’s defenses of sufficientarianism stem from fundamental misunderstandings related to the concepts of continuity, welfarism, value satiability, and their interconnectedness with sufficientarianism. In the end, we will argue that Prospect Utilitarianism (PU) is a superior alternative to sufficientarianism."
Hun Chung,"Chain Connection, Close-Knitness, and the Difference Principle",2022,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/716968,"When distributing the benefits produced by social cooperation, Rawls’s difference principle targets a specific group (i.e., the least advantaged group) and requires its expectations to be maximized. One natural worry is whether the practical application of the difference principle comes with a significant cost to other groups in society. Rawls was quite aware of this potential worry and gave his earnest efforts to respond to it. His solution comes from his notions of chain connection and close-knitness. Rawls’s claim was that whenever society satisfies both chain connection and close-knitness, the practical implementation of the difference principle will (a) always lead to strict Pareto improvements, and, as a result, (b) the final state will be Pareto optimal. In this article, it will be shown that under close scrutiny neither of these claims holds even when society is both chain connected and close-knit."

Notwithstanding limitations in accuracy and resolution of the data available from public sources, we pinpoint significant trends exploiting information in curves and shapes with Functional Data Analysis techniques. These depict two starkly different epidemics; an “exponential” one unfolding in Lombardia and the worst hit areas of the north, and a milder, “flat(tened)” one in the rest of the country—including Veneto, where cases appeared concurrently with Lombardia but aggressive testing was implemented early on. We find that mobility and positivity can predict COVID-19 mortality, also when controlling for relevant covariates. Among the latter, primary care appears to mitigate mortality, and contacts in hospitals, schools and …"

Notwithstanding limitations in the accuracy and reliability of publicly available data, we are able to exploit information in curves and shapes through Functional Data Analysis techniques. Specifically, we document differences in magnitude and variability between the two waves; while both were characterized by a co-occurrence of 'exponential' and 'mild' mortality patterns, the second spread much more broadly and asynchronously through the country. Moreover, we find evidence of a significant positive association between local mobility and mortality in both epidemic waves and corroborate the effectiveness of timely restrictions in curbing mortality. The techniques we describe could capture additional signals of interest if applied, for instance, to data on cases and positivity rates. However, we show that the quality of such data, at least in the case of Italian provinces, was too poor to support meaningful analyses."
Jacopo Di Iorio,Reinterpreting Economic Complexity: A co-clustering approach,2024,https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16199,"Economic growth results from countries' accumulation of organizational and technological capabilities. The Economic and Product Complexity Indices, introduced as an attempt to measure these capabilities from a country's basket of exported products, have become popular to study economic development, the geography of innovation, and industrial policies. Despite this reception, the interpretation of these indicators proved difficult. Although the original Method of Reflections suggested a direct interconnection between country and product metrics, it has been proved that the Economic and Product Complexity Indices result from a spectral clustering algorithm that separately groups similar countries or similar products, respectively. This recent approach to economic and product complexity conflicts with the original one and treats separately countries and products. However, building on previous interpretations of the indices and the recent evolution in spectral clustering, we show that these indices simultaneously identify two co-clusters of similar countries and products. This viewpoint reconciles the spectral clustering interpretation of the indices with the original Method of Reflections interpretation. By proving the often neglected intimate relationship between country and product complexity, this approach emphasizes the role of a selected set of products in determining economic development while extending the range of applications of these indicators in economics."
Jacopo Di Iorio,funBIalign: a hierachical algorithm for functional motif discovery based on mean squared residue scores,2025,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-024-10537-y,"Motif discovery is gaining increasing attention in the domain of functional data analysis. Functional motifs are typical “shapes” or “patterns” that recur multiple times in different portions of a single curve and/or in misaligned portions of multiple curves. In this paper, we define functional motifs using an additive model and we propose funBIalign for their discovery and evaluation. Inspired by clustering and biclustering techniques, funBIalign is a multi-step procedure which uses agglomerative hierarchical clustering with complete linkage and a functional distance based on mean squared residue scores to discover functional motifs, both in a single curve (eg, time series) and in a set of curves. We assess its performance and compare it to other recent methods through extensive simulations. Moreover, we use funBIalign for discovering motifs in two real-data case studies; one on food price inflation and one on temperature …"
Jacopo Di Iorio,Biclustering algorithms and interactive tools for the exploration of multivariate and functional data,2020,https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/153060,"We are living the revolution of data. Due to their recently imposed central role in the society, it has become fundamental to summarize and visualize them using many different techniques. In addition, considering the informational wealth that well-managed data could produce in many different fields, it is important to represent and express the used methods and their results to a wide and broad audience. It is thus evident that, in the age of data, creating new algorithms and improving older ones should go hand by hand with the introduction of proper ways to divulge those methods and results. Therefore this thesis, presented as a collection of papers, is structured in two parts: the first one, Part I, deals with the introduction of a new family of biclustering algorithms for functional data, the funBI family; the second one, Part II, focuses on divulging statistical results or, more generally, statistics to a non-statistical audience."

We study the effect of a mobile phone application that allows citizens to monitor school construction projects in Brazilian municipalities.

Our results show that the app has a null impact on school construction indicators. Additionally, we find that politicians are unresponsive to individual requests. The results question the impact of bottom-up monitoring on public service performance and suggest that interventions targeted at other groups, or focused on different issues, may produce better policy outcomes."

Despite the importance of institutional design for democratic governance, the effect of legislative features on citizen welfare remains little understood. In this article, we use a formal model to show that increasing legislature size improves public goods delivery. We argue that changes in bargaining costs depend on whether additional legislators share the executive's party affiliation: More opposition members reduce the equilibrium public goods provision, while more government‐aligned members increase it. We test this theory by exploiting sharp discontinuities in city‐council size in Brazil. We show that an additional city councilor has a 91% chance of belonging to the mayoral coalition, and this significantly improves primary school enrollment and infant mortality rates. To explore possible mechanisms, we surveyed 174 former city councilors and analyzed …"

In two survey experiments with respondents in Brazil, we examine which characteristics of lynching scenarios garner greater support for lynching and whether providing different types of information about lynching reduces support for it. We find that people often do support community members to take vengeance. In particular, our analysis finds that people strongly support the use of extrajudicial violence by families of victims against men who sexually assault and murder women and children. We also find that criminal punishment and the threat of vendettas reduce support, but appeals to the human rights of victims have zero effect on support for lynchings. Unlike the U.S. experience with lynchings, race was not observed to play an important role in how respondents answered the survey."
Danilo Freire,How many replicators does it take to achieve reliability? Investigating researcher variability in a crowdsourced replication,2021,https://www.sciensano.be/sites/default/files/breznau_how_many_replicators_researcher_variability_osf_3.pdf,"The paper reports findings from a crowdsourced replication. Eighty-four replicator teams attempted to verify results reported in an original study by running the same models with the same data. The replication involved an experimental condition. A “transparent” group received the original study and code, and an “opaque” group received the same underlying study but with only a methods section and description of the regression coefficients without size or significance, and no code. The transparent group mostly verified the original study (95.5%), while the opaque group had less success (89.4%). Qualitative investigation of the replicators’ workflows reveals many causes of non-verification. Two categories of these causes are hypothesized, routine and non-routine. After correcting non-routine errors in the research process to ensure that the results reflect a level of quality that should be present in ‘real-world’research, the rate of verification was 96.1% in the transparent group and 92.4% in the opaque group. Two conclusions follow:(1) Although high, the verification rate suggests that it would take a minimum of three replicators per study to achieve replication reliability of at least 95% confidence assuming ecological validity in this controlled setting, and (2) like any type of scientific research, replication is prone to errors that derive from routine and undeliberate actions in the research process. The latter suggests that idiosyncratic researcher variability might provide a key to understanding part of the “reliability crisis” in social and behavioral science and is a reminder of the importance of transparent and well documented workflows."

Their proposition is currently known as the “law of 1/” and has been widely cited by scholars in political science and public administration. However, recent studies have questioned the validity of the theory. In this paper, we estimate the first meta-analysis of the relationship between the number of legislators and public spending. Based on a sample of 26 empirical studies, we find little effect of legislature size on government budgets. The available evidence suggests that, if such an effect exists, it is driven by an increase in the upper chamber, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the results. Our meta-regressions also indicate that study coefficients vary significantly according to modelling specifications, such as estimation method or variable selection."

Though data preprocessing and storage methods have developed considerably over the past few years, there is little agreement on what constitutes the best set of data validation practices in the social sciences. In this paper I provide five simple steps that can help students and practitioners improve their data validation processes. I discuss how to create testable validation functions, how to increase construct validity, and how to incorporate qualitative knowledge in statistical measurements. I present the concepts according to their level of abstraction, and I provide practical examples on how scholars can add my suggestions to their work."

In this paper, I show how scholars can use automated machine learning (AutoML) tools to preprocess their data and create powerful estimation methods with minimal human input. I demonstrate the functionalities of three open-source, easy-to-use AutoML algorithms, and I replicate a well-designed forecasting model to highlight how researchers can achieve similar results with only a few lines of code."

In many developing countries, however, vector management programmes fail to reach their goals due to low worker productivity. Research suggests that financial incentives may increase the productivity of health personnel, yet there is little evidence about the impact of monetary rewards on A. aegypti-reduction strategies. We evaluated whether individual and collective financial incentives improve the performance of healthcare workers fighting A. aegypti, as well as their effect on city-level numbers of dengue hospitalisations.We hired and trained subjects to visit households, find A. aegypti breeding sites, and eliminate mosquito larvae in the city of Rio Verde, Brazil. We randomly assigned workers into three groups. The control group received a flat compensation for their tasks, while workers in the two treatment groups received individual and collective monetary bonuses, respectively. Financial rewards increased the number of cleaned breeding sites in both treatment groups (individual and team bonuses), and the collective treatment also improved larvae extermination. The intervention lowered dengue hospitalisations in 10.3%, but the result was not consistent across all model specifications.A. aegypti control programmes may benefit from alternative compensation schemes, especially when provided to teams. For this strategy to succeed, financial incentives have to be distributed widely as their aggregate effect is limited. More research is needed to assess whether higher worker …"

In these years, the use of democracy indices has changed fundamentally. For a long time, Polity IV and Freedom House had dominated the political science literature when measuring democracy; since 2016, however, V-Dem has reshuffled the cards. In the field of conceptualizing and measuring democracy, it is a challenge to write a book with up-to-date methods and discussions on conceptualization, measurement, and aggregation strategies due to the voluminous literature and debates on democracy conceptualization and aggregation rules. Overall, the Varieties of Democracy volume has more than stood up to this challenge.In the first part of the book, which comprises 7 chapters, the team of 23 authors introduces the conceptual rationale and methodological foundations of the V-Dem project. In the first chapter, the authors introduce the origin, historical development and infrastructure of the V-Dem project, noting that it is the largest democracy dataset, and probably the largest collaborative data-collection effort in political science, with a cumulative budget of more than 26 million USD. The V-Dem project includes 7 principal investigators, 17 project managers, more than 30 regional managers who manage more than 3000 country experts, on whose codings the V-Dem data rest. Including leading scholars on democracy and social science research methods is definitely a key success factor of the project.

Scholars have debated whether concentrating appointment power in a single individual or diffusing appointment power across many individuals best promotes gender diversification. Others have claimed that the precise structure of the process matters less than fundamental changes in the process. We clarify these theoretical mechanisms, derive testable implications concerning the appointment of the first woman to a state’s highest court, and then develop a matched-pair research design within a Rosenbaum permutation approach to observational studies. Using a global sample beginning in 1970, we find that constitutional change to the judicial selection process decreases the time until the appointment of the first woman justice. These results reflect claims that point to institutional disruptions as critical drivers of gender …"

The Justice Department background paper used to justify this decision cited two papers published by the American Economic Association. These papers used SME data collected with a 2014 Freedom of Information Act request and concluded that SME, supplied to local law enforcement by the federal government via the 1033 Program, reduces crime. Here we show that the findings of these studies are not credible due to problems with the data. Using more detailed audit data on 1033 SME, we show that the 2014 data are flawed and that the more recent data provide no evidence that 1033 SME reduces crime."

Additionally, we find that a sizable portion of the American public is more likely than not to vote for candidates who promise to pass policies that “disproportionately harm” supporters of the opposing political party, and we demonstrate experimental evidence of demand/preference for candidates who promise cruelty among those who exhibit high amounts of schadenfreude. In sum, our results suggest that partisan schadenfreude is widespread and has disturbing implications for American political behavior."

We empirically evaluate this second prediction with original officer-involved shooting data from 2010 to 2017 for eight local police jurisdictions, finding that Black fatality rates are significantly lower than White fatality rates and that this significance would survive an omitted covariate three times as strong as any of our observed covariates. Furthermore, using outcome test methodology and a comparability assumption, we estimate that at least 30% of Black civilians shot by the police would not have been shot had they been White. An omitted covariate would need to be at least three times as strong as any of our observed covariates to eliminate this finding. Finally, any omitted …"

This chapter has two goals. First, to summarize some of the findings published since Bullock and Ha (2011) and to consider the implications these findings have for mediation analysis. Second, to consider the situations in which a close alternative to mediation analysis would be useful (either as a supplement or a substitute).

The results have often been given causal interpretations. While recent work and this article both show that some types of BOD are equivalent to a counterfactual-based treatment effect/selection bias decomposition, this equivalence does not hold in general. Given this lack of general equivalence, in this article based on the counterfactual framework, we propose a method of treatment effect deviation (TED) to study social inequality. Essentially, the TED assesses to what extent the omission of particular covariates (i.e., selection bias in the omitted variables) can alter the estimated treatment effect. The TED has a better causal interpretation and can be estimated nonparametrically (and hence is more robust to model misspecification errors). Therefore, the TED may serve as an …"

Treatments included some form of factual information about the police shootings in respondents’ cities (e.g., the actual total number).

However, we show that such analyses are subject to biases unless strong assumptions hold. Using linear constant-effects models, we present asymptotic bias formulas for three estimators (with and without measurement error): IV with post-instrument covariates, IV without post-instrument covariates, and ordinary least squares. In large samples and when the model provides a reasonable approximation, these formulas sometimes allow the analyst to bracket the parameter of interest with two estimators and allow the analyst to choose the estimator with the least asymptotic bias. We illustrate these points with a discussion of the settler mortality IV used by Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson."

We show that the role of these covariates in applied research is often unclear and that there exists confusion regarding their ability to mitigate violations of the exclusion restriction. We explain when and how existing adjustment strategies may lead to “post-instrument” bias. We then discuss assumptions that are sufficient to identify various treatment effects when adjustment for post-instrument variables is required. In general, these assumptions are highly restrictive, albeit they sometimes are testable. We also show that other existing tests are generally misleading. Then, we introduce a sensitivity analysis that uses information on variables influenced by the instrument to gauge the effect of potential violations of the exclusion restriction. We illustrate it in two replications of existing analyses and summarize our results in easy-to-understand guidelines."

Yet despite the attention given to high-profile shootings, it is extremely difficult to draw wider conclusions about the frequency and outcomes of police gunfire because there is no systematic and centralized source of information on these incidents. This pioneering book draws on original data, compiled by the authors, to examine police shootings, both fatal and non-fatal, in hundreds of American cities. It documents racial disparities in shooting incidents and shows that the media spotlight on the most shocking fatal shootings tell only part of the story of police gunfire in our cities. The authors find that there are patterns in when, where, and whom the police shoot, and they present strong evidence of unjustifiable disparities. It’s not just that young, unarmed Black men are disproportionately subjected to gunfire during encounters with police officers; there is also a disproportionate concentration of shootings in the places where most Black and Hispanic urbanites live, even accounting for violent crime rates and other factors. As a consequence, Black and Hispanic residents of large cities are disproportionately exposed to police gunfire, even when they are not themselves the targets of it. The authors offer other insights as well, exploring the connection between police department funding and rates of shootings, and considering the influence of a city’s political leadership on police use of gunfire. It is only through a deeper understanding of police shootings, the …"

Adam N.

Unfortunately, the identification and estimation of the controlled direct effect—the natural causal quantity of interest for this question—has required strong selectionon-observables assumptions for any mediator. We leverage a recent experimental study with multiple survey waves of follow-up to identify and estimate the controlled direct effect using the changes in the outcome and mediator over time. This design allows us to weaken the identification assumptions to allow for linear and time-constant unmeasured confounding between the mediator and the outcome. Furthermore, we develop a semiparametrically efficient and doubly robust estimator for these quantities. We find that there is a robust controlled direct effect of perspective-taking conversations when subjective feelings are neutral but not positive or negative."

Adam N. Glynn,The Effect of Public Information about Police Shootings of Civilians on Public Support for Police Reforms,2021,https://osf.io/h32e5/resources,"Does exposure to accurate information about local police shootings of civilians affect public support for proposed police reforms? Prior studies examine whether narrative and visual information about police behavior affects individuals' perceptions of the police and policing. Our study uses municipal data on police shootings of civilians to investigate whether, if at all, receiving accurate information about police shooting in their city influences public support for police reform. Through YouGov, we conduct a survey experiment in 2021 in ten large US cities. We randomly assign respondents to treatments of descriptive statistics on police shootings in their cities:(a) total number of civilians police shot in 2020,(b) total number of shootings with a disaggregation by armed and unarmed civilians shot, or (c) total number of shootings with a breakdown of fatal and non-fatal shootings. A control group receives no information about police shootings for their cities. All respondents' make guesses about the number of police shootings in their cities before random assignment. We identify treatment effects on support for five proposed policing reforms:(1) limiting armed police officer involvement in low-level traffic stops,(2) using unarmed “first responders” instead of police to address mental health emergencies,(3) reducing the use of no-knock warrants,(4) reducing qualified immunity protections, and (5) empowering civilian oversight boards to review police misconduct. The findings may inform policymakers about how public knowledge of police shootings may influence public support for police reforms."

However, this book also presents a warning: without help from the humanities, data science can distort the past and lead to perilous errors. The book opens with a rogue's gallery of errors, then tours the ground-breaking analyses that have resulted from collaborations between humanists and data scientists. Jo Guldi explores how text mining can give a glimpse of the changing history of the past-for example, how quickly Americans forgot the history of slavery. Textual data can even prove who was responsible in Congress for silencing environmentalism over recent decades. The book ends with an impassioned vision of what text mining in defence of democracy would look like, and why humanists need to be involved."

Land is shown to be a central motor of politics in the twentieth century: the basis of movements for giving reparations to formerly colonized people, protests to limit the rent paid by urban tenants, intellectual battles among development analysts, and the capture of land by squatters taking matters into their own hands. The book describes the results of state-engineered"" land reform"" policies beginning in Ireland in 1881 until US-led interests and the World Bank effectively killed them off in 1974. The Long Land War provides a definitive narrative of land redistribution alongside an unflinching critique of its failures, set against the background of the rise and fall of nationalism, communism, internationalism, information technology, and free-market economics. In considering how we could make the earth livable for all, she works out the important relationship between property ownership and justice on a changing planet."

The article highlights the apparent conflict between expert governance on the one hand, and, on the other hand, calls for democratization that reflect the diverse perspectives of groups whose rights and labor have been exploited over historical timescales. Drawing on the history of bureaucracy and governance, this article argues that the apparent contradiction between the two poles of discourse can be reconciled by a system of information infrastructure designed to create a robust, accountable system of environmental data monitoring that also accounts for the work of inclusive community groups as stewards of landscapes. The article concludes by recommending a 6-point “Outline of an Information Infrastructure for Responsive, Accountable Governance of the …"

This essay explores the use of a distinctiveness algorithm from library science for measuring the distinctiveness of manuscripts, tf-idf, recast as ""tf-ipf"" for the study of the terms most distinctive of historical periods. In a case study, tf-ipf is applied to the text of Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, varying the ""period"" from a 20-year horizon to a 6-month or one-day horizon. It is shown that the algorithm's assessments of what is most distinctive of 20-year and 10-year periods largely matches the consensus of British historians, while debates that held parliament's attention for six months or fewer have largely fallen beneath the threshold of scholarly attention. Attending to concerns that took up parliamentary debate for six months or fewer, the essay argues that tf-ipf thus presents a metric of parliamentary attention that …"

Official records of modern political bodies are widely available in digitized form and provide one of the primary sources with which digital historians have trained their methods. This article applies the process of “reducing” textual expressions to regular form to investigate how British members of Parliament talked about empire in extremely general terms: which places did they mention, how much, and in what context. Reducing parliamentary speech to regular occurrences makes it possible to quantitatively generalize about regular and predictable structures—for example, the Eurocentric bias of Parliament and Parliament’s bias toward portion of the empire under long command, with certain notable exceptions. The technique lends itself to a wide variety …"

The pipeline concept, adopted with limitations by the humanities, documents how a suite of algorithms produces a particular research result, with the goal of enabling interoperability, transparency, and iteration by future scholars who may switch out particular algorithms within the pipeline with different results. A pipeline-based application amplifies the concepts of interoperability and transparency for users by allowing the researcher to toggle on and off particular options, for example selecting and deselecting particular topics of interest from a program of visualizations based on a topic model of a large body of text. Pipelines support modular, interoperable, transparent, and documented processes of research that lend themselves to Prof. Guldi's Theory of Critical Search—the argument that critical …"

Jo Guldi,The Revolution in Text Mining for Historical Analysis is Here,2024,https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/129/2/519/7690490,"We have known since Vico to think of written text and oral traditions as two systems of culture. Social historians have long treated the rise of literacy itself as an important index of modernity, although collectors of oral traditions have typically transcribed folk songs and oral stories into text. Modern historians track the appearance of different genres of writing, from parliamentary blue books to the newspaper to the novel to published transcripts of court cases, as an index of evolving institutions and markets. And knowledge of the way that these texts circulated—whether read aloud in the post office or debated on bulletin board systems on the early internet—is often a clue to important social structures. The knowledge accessible through text does not exhaust in any way the full repository of artifacts that historians use—which of course extends to the formats of texts; to visual and audio media, which may or may not …"

In the many years of its absence, microhistory steeped in details and based on a short-term vision prevailed, with fragmented studies limited to a narrow circle of readers, hindering coherent synthetic works. But this return, aided by the abundance of digital tools and data, is framed by new ambitions represented in the desire to contribute to the interpretation of events and phenomena from a global perspective, to provide synthetic research that can be read by specialists and laypersons alike, and to enrich the debate related to public policies alongside other actors in the neighbouring humanities and social sciences."

But presentism of this kind also can illuminate neglected truths. In Whelehan’s case, a global understanding of Ireland in the world leads him to capture truths about earlier episodes of global Ireland that were less visible when all histories tended towards the Easter Rebellion. The new Irish studies of diaspora—of which Whelehan’s is part—reveal how the framework of nationalism and the shape of the national archive has limited our sight. Whelehan’s inclusive, international portrait of Irish land politics demonstrates the variety of political radicalisms brought together in England and Ireland around 1879–81, when the Irish Land League and Ladies’ Land League began to organise programmes to resist eviction. As Whelehan demonstrates, a radical wing …"

As a result of the# BlackLivesMatter movement, any citizens previously ignorant of the acts of violence perpetrated by the police against people of color became familiar with those facts, which were circulated almost instantly by citizen observers armed with phones. Calls for action were amplified in real time by social media, leading to some of the largest protests in the history of the United States. During the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic, newspaper readers around the world became accustomed to reading daily updates on the disease’s spread, packaged as bar charts and data-driven maps, with individuals, families, schools, and corporations adjusting their plans on a weekly or even daily basis to respond to the latest information about the disease’s vectors. At the same time, scientists and UN advisory bodies have identified the present decade as a moment of unprecedented crisis, writ in terms of a limited opportunity for the planet’s inhabitants to decide to keep carbon in the ground (Asayama et al.). Through this series of emergencies, experts have mobilized data—in the form of stories, numbers, and figures—to help the public make sense of their experience. Emergencies beg for a response, and often the timeliness of the response is critical in its appropriateness to the problem in question. In the case of climate change, President Joseph Biden has set a deadline of 2030 for limiting carbon emissions, based on the recommendations of scientists, who in turn based their consensus on data collected and analyzed over …"
